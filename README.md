# Calculus of Communicating Systems

The calculus of communicating systems (CCS) is a process calculus introduced by Robin Milner around 1980 and the title of a book describing the calculus. Its actions model indivisible communications between exactly two participants. The formal language includes primitives for describing parallel composition, choice between actions and scope restriction. CCS is useful for evaluating the qualitative correctness of properties of a system such as deadlock or livelock.
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites


You must be able to run .sml files (Standard ML of New Jersey)
You can install from  https://www.smlnj.org/ the SML compiler it's avaiable for UNIX & Windows System.
After the installation
```sh
$ sml ccs.sml
```

Otherwise you can execute it in online compiler as https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_smlnj_online.php just copying it in and then push the play button.
